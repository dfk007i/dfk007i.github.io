      <h3 id="linux-system-administration">Linux system administration</h3>
      <p><strong>Linux system administration</strong>is a process of setting up, configuring, and managing a computer
        system in aLinuxenvironment. System administration involves creating a user account, taking reports, performing
        backup, updating configuration files, documentation, and performing recovery actions. The user who manages the
        server, fixes configuration issues, recommends new software updates, and updates document is the<strong>system
          administrator</strong>.</p>
      <h3 id="linux-operating-system">Linux operating system</h3>
      <p>The Linux operating system was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The<strong>Linux operating
          system</strong>is an open-sourced system software that manages the computer hardware resources and computing
        devices. The operating system manages the communication between your application software and hardware
        resources. Because it is an open source software, it allows the user to have access to its source code, give
        room for further modification, and allow for further distribution as received.The Linux family is
        called<strong>distribution (distro)</strong>, whereas the Windows operating system is called version.</p>
      <h3 id="components-of-linux-operating-system">Components of Linux operating system</h3>
      <p>The Linux operating system contains the following components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bootloader</strong>: This is a software that manages the boot process of your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Kernel</strong>: The kernel is also called the Linux kernel and is the system traffic controller
          that allocates system resources to the running application. Software applications request the kernel for
          hardware resources such as disc space, RAM, and CPU. Software applications use theAPIto work with the kernel
          on a high level of abstraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Init system</strong>: This is a subsystem that bootstraps the user space and controls daemons. The
          init system manages the boot process after it is handled by the bootloader.</li>
        <li><strong>Daemons</strong>: Daemons are programs or drivers that manage underground applications like printing
          sounds, network, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical server</strong>: The graphical server system supports the graphic display on the screen.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Desktop environment</strong>: The desktop environment allows the user to interface with the
          operating system. The Linux OS offers a variety of desktop environments with their own built-in applications
          to choose from.</li>
        <li><strong>Application</strong>: The desktop environment does not offer all of the applications a user might
          need, but Linux allows the user to install additional applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Linux operating system is used as a client-side (desktop) and server-side operating system.</p>
      <h3 id="linux-operating-system-interface">Linux operating system interface</h3>
      <p>The Linux operating system offers two types of user interface,CLIandGUI. The CLI is mostly used on the
        server-side, while GUI is used on the client-side. The interface depends on what the user intends to achieve
        with the Linux OS.</p>
      <p>The Linux OS serves as the backbone for network infrastructure, Cloud computing, web servers, database servers,
        email servers, and directory service. Each of these servers and services requires a system administrator to
        manage them.</p>
      <p>System administration is carried out by an expert in the IT (Information Technology) industry. The expert
        ensures that all computing devices and networks work properly. The job demand depends on the kind of system,
        software application, and work environment.</p>
      <p>System administrator allows the administrator to allocate user privileges based on the required resources and
        function of the user. The system administrator is the most privileged user, known as the_super user_, and
        determines what computing resources each user receives.</p>

      <h3 id="about-coding-test">About This Coding Assessment</h3>
      <p><strong>This assessment measures a wide spectrum of coding skills</strong>and makes use of four hands-on coding
        challenges that you can take in a language of your choice.<strong>(Java or Python)</strong>.</p>
      <h3 id="simplest">The Simplest Task covers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Basic control flow and common data types...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And complexity grows gradually with the remaining tasks. Up to writing clever <strong>mini-algorithms where
          algorithmic efficiency counts</strong></p>
      <p>The tasks require nothing more than the common language constructs & functions: <strong>no specific libraries
          or frameworks are required.</strong></p>


      <h3 id="note">Note:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>can't take on mobile</li>
        <li>It is required to present a valid ID and session will be recorded for fraud prevention purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Various positions may require different proficiency levels. Your result will not only apply to the current job
        position but can also unlock many other positions.</p>
